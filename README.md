# Quantum Computing with Qiskit

Explore quantum computing concepts using Qiskit, including superposition, entanglement, and measurement.

## Experiments

- **Hadamard Gate**: Creates superposition and visualizes results.
- **Quantum Coin Flip**: Simulates a fair coin flip and displays probabilities.
- **Bell State**: Entangles qubits and verifies correlation.
- **Plus State**: Prepares the |+‚ü© state and measures probabilities.

## Key Concepts

- **Superposition**: Enables parallel computation.
- **Interference**: Enhances correct solutions.
- **Measurement Collapse**: Extracts final results.

## Running the Code

Run the scripts in a Python environment to observe quantum behavior.
